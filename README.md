# ML-Logistic-Regression_Fisher-Discriminant-Analysis
A ML algorithm to differenciate several types of Wine.

Experimenting many methods for Logistic Regression and comparing their accuracy.
Run main_softmax_method.py directly. For the FDA method, first run my_LDA.py and predict.py before running main_FDA.py.
# So far :

The Softmax method gives an accuracy of 96.15% whereas the FDA method gives an accuracy of 58% for this dataset.
